      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        With over five years of professional experience, I specialise in Agile methodologies and process improvement, demonstrating a continuous commitment to optimising operational performance. At TQI, my mission was to align team values and motivations with the organisational culture, bringing diverse perspectives to enrich the collective experience. My work focuses on facilitating collaboration and fostering an environment where innovation thrives.

        In my most recent role as an Agile Coach at TQI, I spearheaded initiatives to enhance operational efficiency and software development quality. I collaborated with a dedicated team, employing Agile methodologies to overcome challenges and achieve significant goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to that, as a Scrum Master at Bowe, I contributed to the evolution and merger of two large companies, strengthening our market position.
